          <p>You can use the <code>ipc</code> module to send synchronous messages between processes as well, but note that the synchronous nature of this method means that it <b>will block</b> other operations while completing its task.</p>
          
          <p>This example sends a synchronous message, "ping", from this process (renderer) to the main process. The main process then replies with "pong".</p>
