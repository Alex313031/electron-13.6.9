Subject: Use a 100ms timer in
 MacScrollbarAnimatorImpl::StartScrollbarPaintTimer

MacScrollbarAnimatorImpl::StartScrollbarPaintTimer has a timer that
runs while ShouldSuspendScrollAnimations is true. The timer was changed
from 100ms to 1ms in https://crrev.com/376453. This was later changed to
0ms in https://crrev.com/434428 which caused a performance regression
(https://crbug.com/713669). The timer was then changed back to 1ms in
https://crrev.com/470823 with a comment about giving other tasks time to
cancel the timer. This patch restores the 100ms timer. The comment has
been removed because this timer is more of a polling mechanism.
