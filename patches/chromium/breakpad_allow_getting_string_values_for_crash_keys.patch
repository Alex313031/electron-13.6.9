Subject: breakpad: allow getting string values for crash keys

Linux is currently recording both crashpad and breakpad keys on linux
(because upstream is experimenting with crashpad-on-linux). We can fetch
the string values for crashpad keys on win/mac, and they're easily
available on linux too, this just exposes them.

Should be upstreamed, or failing that, deleted once crashpad is enabled
on linux. If removing this patch doesn't cause a compile failure, it's
fine to delete!
