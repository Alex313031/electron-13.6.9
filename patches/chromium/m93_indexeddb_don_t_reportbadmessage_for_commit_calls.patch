Subject: M93: [IndexedDB] Don't ReportBadMessage for Commit calls.

We do seem to be getting commit calls quite a lot even after a
transaction has already started to be committed or aborted, so for now
just avoid killing the renderer until we figure out where these calls
are coming from.

(cherry picked from commit f9bf7be854ed80a792953e94dd56e1269a5bbe98)
